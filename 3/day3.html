        The history of Plovdiv spans more than eight millennia. The numerous nations that lived here have left their
        traces on the twelve-metre-thick (39-foot) cultural layers of the city. The earliest signs of habitation on the
        territory of Plovdiv date as far back as the 6th millennium BC. Plovdiv has settlement traces including
        necropolises dating from the Neolithic, roughly 6000-5000 BC, like the mounds Yasa Tepe 1 in Philipovo district
        and Yasa Tepe 2 in Lauta park.
        </p>         <p style="text-indent: 10%">
    Archaeologists have discovered fine pottery and objects of
        everyday life on Nebet Tepe from as early as the Chalcolithic, showing that at the end of the 4th millennium BC,
        there already was an established settlement there which was continuously inhabited since then.
        Thracian necropolises dating back to the 2nd-3rd millennium BC have been discovered, while the Thracian town
        was established between the 2nd and the 1st millennium BC.
    </p>         <p style="text-indent: 10%">
    The town was a fort of the independent local Thracian tribe Bessi.
        In 516 BC during the rule of Darius the Great, Thrace was included in the Persian empire.
        In 492 BC the Persian general Mardonius subjected Thrace again, and it became nominally a vassal of Persia
        until 479 BC and the early rule of Xerxes I. The town was included in the Odrysian kingdom (460 BC-46 AD),
        a Thracian tribal union. The town was conquered by Philip II of Macedon and the Odrysian king was deposed
        in 342 BC. Ten years after the Macedonian invasion the Thracian kings started to exercise power again after
        the Odrysian Seuthes III had re-established their kingdom under Macedonian suzerainty as a result of a somehow
        successful revolt against Alexander the Great's rule resulting in neither victory, nor defeat, but stalemate.
        The Odrysian kingdom gradually overcome the Macedonian suzerainty, while the city was destroyed by the Celts
        as part of the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe, most likely in the 270s BC. In 183 BC Philip V of
        Macedon conquered the city, but shortly after the Thracians re-conquered it.

        In 72 BC the city was seized by the Roman general Marcus Lucullus but was soon restored to Thracian control.
        In AD 46 the city was finally incorporated into the Roman Empire by emperor Claudius; it served as metropolis
        (capital) of the province of Thrace and gained a city status in the late 1st century. Trimontium was an
        important crossroad for the Roman Empire and was called "the largest and most beautiful of all cities" by
        Lucian. Although it was not the capital of the Province of Thrace, the city was the largest and most important
        centre in the province. As such the city was the seat of the Union of Thracians. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%">
        In those times,
        the Via Militaris (or Via Diagonalis), the most important military road in the Balkans, passed through the
        city. The Roman times were a period of growth and cultural excellence. The ancient ruins tell a story of a
        vibrant, growing city with numerous public buildings, shrines, baths, theatres, a stadium and the only
        developed ancient water supply system in Bulgaria. The city had an advanced water system and sewerage.
        In 179 a second wall was built to encompass Trimontium which had already extended out of the Three hills
        into the valley. Many of those are still preserved and can be seen by tourists. Today only a small part of the
        ancient city has been excavated. <br> </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%">
        In 250 AD the whole city was burned down by the Goths, led by their ruler Cniva, and many of its citizens,
        according to Ammianus Marcellinus numbering 100,000, died or were taken captive. It took a century and
        hard work to recover the city. However, it was destroyed again by Attila's Huns in 441-442 and by the Goths
        of Teodoric Strabo in 471. <br> </p>
