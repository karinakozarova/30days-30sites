        Beer is the world's oldest  and most widely consumed alcoholic
        drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea.
        The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the
        fermentation of sugars, mainly derived from cereal grain starches -
        most commonly from malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and
        rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add
        bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings
        such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included.</p>
